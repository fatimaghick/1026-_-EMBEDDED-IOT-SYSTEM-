Repository Overview
This repository serves as a structured collection of ESP32 practical experiments that progressively build from basic to advanced IoT concepts.
Each folder represents one lab or home task focused on different peripherals, sensors, and real-world interfacing techniques.

Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:

Demonstrate understanding of embedded systems programming using the ESP32 microcontroller.
Practice hardware interfacing with components like LEDs, buzzers, DHT sensors, and LDRs.
Explore timers, interrupts, and PWM control in real IoT applications.
Integrate sensors and displays to visualize data meaningfully.
Main Components and Technologies
